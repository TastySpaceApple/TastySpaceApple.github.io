This is not what this work is about, however. The communication in this work is between the author’s brain and itself. The mind, be it a marvellous piece of accidental engineering, is lacking in introspective abilities. The concepts, thought out by the brain, are too dynamic. Our minds continue to process them, straining to focus and keep desirable concepts afloat amidst all other electrical signals going around (amongst the eating, drinking, sleeping, fearing, swimming, jumping, tennis of all sorts). By anchoring the concepts to words, and the words unto the paper, one can actually extend the “working memory” he/she can work with. The paper serves as a historical storage for the thoughts, allowing the brain to go forwards and backwards between different things that came up in a set length of time (the time of writing). This allows the concepts to be developed and built upon instead of being reprocessed again and again until they’re ground up to fine mind dust. The paper you are holding, be it physically a piece of processed timber, a digital representation of a paper, or else, is not just words from the author’s brain; that is, the paper is not simply a receptacle the author poured concepts from his brain into, but rather an extension of his brain. You are holding the instrument of thought which created the concept detailed in this work. You might as well be holding the author’s frontal cortex, or amigdala, as the dialogue between the brain and the paper is what created the concepts portrayed henceforth. The paper and the words anchored to it served as an assistant author - sadly, not credited. Hopefully, as the written dialogue progresses, scanning the page would be similar to scanning the author’s brain. A brain scan that would have required a long process of persuasion, processing, appraising and reappraising, until the brain, looking in the mirror that is the paper can see itself in the reflection and say: “pretty close”.
