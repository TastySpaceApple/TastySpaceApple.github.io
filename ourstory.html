The lovers in Rodin's 1882 famous statue "The Kiss" (based on a story which appears in Dante's Inferno) are depicted kissing passionately for the first time, but they never got to kiss a second time because they were killed a moment later, before their lips had a chance to touch again.

We have been good friends for two years. When we met he had just moved to Tel Aviv from Denmark, and I was living with my boyfriend at the time (who was older and not very nice to me).

I crashed at his place in a sleeping bag for a few days when that boyfriend and I broke up and I had to find somewhere to sleep until I got a place of my own. We used to meet 3-4 days a week - we just hung out, watched YouTube, talked, walked around the city. About a year after we've met, and after we've been pretty much insperatable, we chatted on Telegram and confessed that we might have feelings for each other. I cried a lot. Finally telling him was so relieving. It was evening, we met outside my building. As I saw him I smiled and ran to him and hugged him. I kissed him, and he kissed me back. But slowly I started feeling him freeze up, he released his grip somewhat and I felt he wasn't in the moment with me anymore. I felt myself losing him forever, also as a friend. He finally stopped my desperate groping of his torso and told me he didn't feel what he thought he would feel, that he guessed he didn't love me like he thought he did. My heart broke that night in a way that could never be fixed.

After that, we stopped seeing each other, and each of us went through his own bizzare process of grieving. I made angry grafitti about him and tried to sleep with everyone he thought was hot (not the healthiest type of revenge, I admit), and he went into his own episode of figuring stuff out.

A month passed and we started meeting again as friends. We couldn't really stay away from each other, I guess. But it didn't feel the same. I felt like I was getting radiation sickness everytime we met, that being so close to him but not being able to touch him was killing me. I limited our meetings to 3 hours tops, while constantly looking at the time when I was with him thinking "You can do it, just stay with him for 30 more minutes and then go. Just try to make everything seem normal again".

I coudln't do it. I stopped seeing him. At the same time, pressure at work and in life was becoming too difficult to bear. I distanced myself from everyone I knew, including him. At that point I've also made up my mind on killing myself.

He tried to contact me for the next 2 months several times. I usually brushed him off, saying I was either busy or out of town. I didn't want to see him. I thought he wanted to show me the new songs he learnt to play on the guitar, or a new website he's made, or whatever it was that would have interested me back when we were still friends - but we weren't friends anymore in my mind.

He had sent me a postcard which I didn't even bother to open and a few links with songs I didn't bother listening to or decrypt their meaning. We were always into hints, him and I, but at that point I was fed up with it. 

A day before the date I had chosen to kill myself I decided waiting was stupid, nothing really mattered anyway, and I was ready. I hastily organized some things that weren't ready yet - namely, a suicide letter and a mixtape, which because being rushed were not as well put together as I would've liked, but I didn't care anymore. That night I rode my bycicle to the beach and layed out everything like I had planned, and like I read on the internet. I sent out one last tweet with the bag already on my head.

You don't need hold your breath. As you can assume, I failed. I regained conciousness bearly 50 minutes after my `attempt` with a coastguard light shining in my eyes from a nearby boat. Knowing I had done something that was technically illegal, I quickly wrapped all my stuff together in a blanket and rode my bycicle back home.

I awoke to the sound of someone frantically opening my apartment door early in the morning. It was him. He read my suicide message on Twitter and wanted to check that I was alright. He told me later that when he saw me laying in bed that morning he thought he was looking at a dead body, that if he had touched me I would have been cold. He touched me gently and said "You're alive".

"I know. It's terrible", I responded. I was a bit high and confused from the drugs I had taken, but I clearly remembered we were over, and that he shouldn't have been there making sure I was okay. I wanted to tell him to fuck off, to go away, but his hand touching me felt so good. I thought I could enjoy his touch a little longer and tell him to go away later. I wasn't in a rush, anyway. I had to get everything ready again for another attempt and it would've taken me at least the rest of that day. So I decided, for that short morning, that I was alright with giving into the fantasy of him being with me, and not letting what I thought his feelings were to get in the way.

I was in the hospital for two weeks, he visited me nearly every day. I hugged him when he came, I didn't care if he didn't want it. I lay my head on his lap, just imagining that when I got out I could still hug him sometimes, even as a friend. I stayed with him for hours, way past the hospital's visiting hours, something for which I was scolded on at numberous occasions by the nurses).

I can't remember when it was that he had told me he loved me. I don't remember when it was that he had told me that the postcard he had sent were his way to say he loved me, or that when he wanted to meet with me, he wanted to tell me he had feelings for me. I do remember sitting in the lobby at the hospital with my phone and headphones, listening to the mixtape he had made for me a month earlier, one that I didn't even try to listen to, and understanding, song after song, what he's being going through these past months and I remember tears dropping from my eyes uncontrollably.

If I had died that day, like I was planning to, I never would have known how he felt about me, and we never would have had our second kiss. Like the figures in the statue, Death would have been quicker than we were.

I still can't believe he really loves me. But I'm ready to live that fantasy for now.

I wish it was just a story, and that it wasn't hard for me living with the decision I had made, and that we weren't dealing with the trauma this had caused. But I hope it was all worth it because it makes a good story.
