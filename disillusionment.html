<span class="title">The illusion of disillusionment</span>
</header>
<pre dir="ltr">
The idea of disillusionment from modern life, and seeking your own authentic self – e.g., leaving the job you don’t like, thinking what more life can offer for you, waking up, as it were, to life’s possibilities and choices – has itself become a cliché, and a common theme in stories, cinema, etc., and so has in itself become an illusion.

The main theme in the illusion of disillusionment is transcending the daily routines and lives we’ve been dictated, and looking for something more. It says we can, at any age, strive to fulfil ourselves, once we find what our authentic self is. An important part is that everyone has something exceptional about them, they just have to find out what it is. Not fulfilling yourself is portrayed as inferior and wrong.

This theme supposedly replaces the earlier obligating theme of living productive-consumerist lives: being good at your job, getting married, starting a family, and buying things to sustain this life such as a house, a car, etc.

Through the common idea of disillusionment we become free of these obligations – we don’t need kids if they don’t make us happy, we don’t need to work somewhere if the job doesn’t suit us. This appears in films (e.g., “Falling down” or “Revolutionary Road”), in which the protagonists are tired of the lives they lead. Having this idea of dissatisfaction present in mainstream culture, to be dispersed and made money from is a testament to the fact that it serves the paradigm. As Debord wrote – “this reflects the simple fact that dissatisfaction itself became a commodity as soon as economic abundance could extend production to the processing of such raw materials” (Society of the Spectacle, Guy Debord, 1967).

The way this dissatisfaction has become a commodity is through soul-searching trips, movies, reality TV, and even Diet Coke ads that address you asking you to live out your dream life. This idea that we can do whatever we want, that we should chase our dreams, is so ingrained in our society that we have become addicted to it. 

But the truth is not everyone have dreams. In fact, I would say most of us do not have a calling we crave all our lives to accomplish. When the illusion of disillusionment asks us to extract a hidden dream, we regurgitate a dream we heard from someone else, or any dream we can scrape around, because we must have a dream. And so we go on Reality TV to a singing contest, and say that, apparently, all our lives all we wanted was to sing.   

Searching hard to find dreams to chase makes for a hard living. Breaking free from that would be this: Neither live the life which is socially expected from you, nor the life that you should owe to yourself, but rather just live the life you live. Life is short, yes, but drinking diet coke won’t make it longer. Nor will going after just one dream that is supposed to make you feel happy once it’s achieved.

This has not yet been made a commodity. It’s hard to sell the feeling of just being content with your life and not wanting anything in particular.
